-- 1. Which are the different genres?
SELECT DISTINCT prime_genre from applestore2;

-- 2. Which is the genre with more apps rated?
SELECT DISTINCT prime_genre, rating_count_tot from applestore2 order by rating_count_tot desc;

-- 3. Which is the genre with more apps?
SELECT prime_genre, COUNT(*) AS app_count
FROM applestore2
GROUP BY prime_genre
ORDER BY app_count DESC;

-- 4. Which is the one with less?
SELECT prime_genre, COUNT(*) AS app_count
FROM applestore2
GROUP BY prime_genre
ORDER BY app_count asc;

-- 5. Take the 10 apps most rated.
SELECT id, track_name, rating_count_tot
FROM labsql.applestore2
ORDER BY rating_count_tot DESC
LIMIT 10; 

-- 6. Take the 10 apps best rated by users.
SELECT track_name, user_rating
FROM applestore2
ORDER BY user_rating DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- 7. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 5. Give some insights.
-- Facebook and Instagram have the  highest total rating (both falling under the social media category) 
-- High rating counts typically reflect a large user base that is actively engaging with the app.

-- 8. Take a look on the data you retrieved in the question 6. Give some insights.
-- the top rated apps all fall under rating 5 which means that the users are highly satisfied with the app,
-- but we don't know in this case how many users rated the application.

-- 9. Now compare the data from questions 5 and 6. What do you see?
-- While the most rated apps are very popular and wildly used the apps with the perfect ratings are 
-- focusing on more specific user groups. High engagement doesn't always mean perfect satisfaction, 
-- it shows that smaller, more focused apps meets the users needs more.

-- 10. How could you take the top 3 regarding the user ratings but also the number of votes?
SELECT track_name, user_rating, rating_count_tot
FROM applestore2
ORDER BY user_rating DESC, rating_count_tot DESC
LIMIT 3;
-- 11. Does people care about the price?
SELECT track_name, rating_count_tot, price
FROM applestore2
ORDER BY price DESC, rating_count_tot desc;

-- Yes, many cheaper apps have much more ratings than the expensive ones which let us believe that many more people use them,
-- but also the specific focus group of the expesive apps are willing to pay the price of the application.
